# React-Redirection ðŸš€

## Please know this package is still under development.

[Redirection](https://en.wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/) is a plugin in wordpress that handles redirects.

This package is for handling redirects using a headless wordpress template.

## How to use.

You can use the packages by importing `{Link}` from `"react-redirection"`

It's a React component, so you can just pass down the things you need as a prop.

:white_check_mark:

```jsx
import { Link } from "@hike/react-redirection";

const App = (data) => (
  <Link
    uri={data?.uri}
    url={data?.url}
    title={data?.title}
    target={data?.target}
  >
    Link
  </Link>
);

export default App;
```
